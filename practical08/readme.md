# GCD Calculation Program

## Overview
This C program calculates the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two positive integers using two methods:
1. **Iterative Method**: Implements the Euclidean algorithm iteratively.
2. **Recursive Method**: Implements the Euclidean algorithm recursively.

## How to Run
Compile and run the program using GCC or any C compiler:
```bash
gcc gcd.c -o gcd -lm
./gcd
```

## Output
Enter two positive integers: 66 45
GCD of 66 and 45 is 3
GCD of 66 and 45 is 3
